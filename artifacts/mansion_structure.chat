    Based explicitly on the following background lore, devise a detailed and intriguing mansion layout for a puzzle-adventure web game:

    
        In the waning years of the 19th century, Lucien Ravenshade, a scholar and explorer of extraordinary ambition and eccentricity, had become an enigma whispered about in drawing rooms across Europe. Born into great wealth, Ravenshade found conventional pursuits unworthy of his restless imagination. His insatiable curiosity, matched only by his boundless resources, drove him across oceans and continents, delving into the unknown realms of both science and myth.

Inspired by the visionary journeys chronicled by his contemporaries—such as Professor Pierre Aronnax's undersea adventures aboard Captain Nemo’s Nautilus, or Phileas Fogg’s legendary voyage around the world—Lucien undertook expeditions into the most remote and forbidding regions of the earth. Each voyage brought back peculiar artifacts, volumes of rare lore, and whispered rumors of discoveries too fantastic to reveal openly.

Yet, it was in the quiet countryside of Northern England that Lucien chose to build Ravenshade Manor. Designed with intricate complexity and riddled with concealed passages, the mansion was more than a mere home: it was a manifestation of Lucien’s obsession with secrecy and discovery. Within its walls, he amassed an unparalleled collection of treasures: ancient maps inscribed in forgotten tongues, contraptions engineered from blueprints too advanced for their era, and fragments of civilizations said to exist only in legend.

In his latter years, Lucien became increasingly withdrawn, speaking cryptically of a groundbreaking revelation—an invention or perhaps a discovery—that would forever alter humanity’s understanding of time and space. He filled his journals with obscure references to "Chronal Resonators," machines capable of bending reality, and doors "between worlds." Drawing from the speculative visions of Jules Verne himself, Lucien hinted at realms buried beneath the earth, submerged in the depths of the ocean, or hidden among the clouds.

Then, without explanation, Lucien vanished.

For decades thereafter, Ravenshade Manor stood sealed and silent, guarded by a trust whose instructions forbade entry except under extraordinary circumstances. Persistent rumors suggested the mansion was more alive than abandoned—strange lights flickering in windows, spectral figures glimpsed through curtains, and music drifting hauntingly from empty halls. The townsfolk whispered that Lucien had not truly departed but instead become ensnared in his own experiments, caught between realities.

Now, a century later, you—a historian renowned for your expertise on Victorian-era mysteries—receive a cryptic invitation bearing the Ravenshade family seal. Curious and compelled by the offer of uncovering truths long buried, you journey to Ravenshade Manor. But upon crossing the threshold, it swiftly becomes apparent that Lucien’s legacy remains active, his puzzles, secrets, and devices waiting patiently for someone clever and bold enough to unravel them.

Each room within Ravenshade Manor is layered with complexity, as if the house itself were an immense puzzle designed by Lucien to protect—and perhaps reveal—his ultimate discovery. From locked chambers and hidden laboratories to secret observatories observing impossible constellations, every passageway opened and puzzle solved draws you closer to Lucien's greatest secret: a device capable of transcending the limitations of space and time.

Yet the mansion is no passive vault; its enigmatic machinery, influenced by Lucien’s dabbling with forces he scarcely understood, constantly rearranges pathways and puzzles, challenging you anew with each step forward. Ravenshade Manor demands intelligence, observation, and courage. To succeed, you must not only decipher the puzzles but understand the ambitions and fears of Lucien Ravenshade himself, unraveling a mystery that spans realms both known and unknowable.

Ultimately, your exploration will determine whether Lucien Ravenshade’s work was madness or genius, and if the secret he left behind holds the potential to illuminate humanity’s future—or doom it.


    Requirements:
    - Precisely 30 uniquely themed rooms influenced by Lucien Ravenshade's Victorian era eccentricities and Jules Verne-inspired inventions.
    - Each room explicitly named (evocative and theme-appropriate) and briefly described.
    - Clearly outline room exits, including stair cases, doorways, locked doors, or secret passages of any kind. (Do not specify the room names of the exits, just the directions.) 
    - Valid exit directions are N, S, E, W, U (up) and D (down).
    - Start with "Grand Vestibule" and end with "Portal Chamber".
    - Keep output strictly in valid JSON format:
    
    {"rooms": [ {"name": "Concise Room Name", "theme": "Room Thematic description", "exits": {"N": "locked door", "U": "staircase", "W": "hidden passage behind bookshelf"} }] }
