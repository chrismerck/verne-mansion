  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. Depict the Grand Foyer with a cracked marble floor extending outward, showcasing the faded elegance of the mansion. On one dominating wall, present a towering, ornate painting of the mansion's stern and dignified founder\u2014the frame should be intricately carved and gilded. To the east, illustrate a solid, finely carved oak door firmly closed, hinting at hidden secrets beyond. Toward the north, depict a wide, elegant archway opening into a grand gallery, gently illuminated to suggest further rooms. The ambiance should be hauntingly majestic, with shadows cast by antique brass sconces and subtle Victorian-style fixtures, evoking a sense of intrigue and historical grandeur.",
  "transform": "Now transform the image to reflect the foyer's changed state: the eyes in the founder's painting should now glow faintly with a mysterious luminescence, casting an eerie, subtle light upon the room. The carved oak door to the east should now be slightly ajar, inviting exploration and suggesting the unlocking of previously hidden secrets. Adjust lighting and shadows minimally to emphasize the supernatural glow from the painting, creating an atmosphere of eerie anticipation and curiosity."
