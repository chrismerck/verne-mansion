  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. Depict a secluded outdoor courtyard surrounded by ivy-covered stone walls, under soft moonlight filtering through drifting clouds. Central to the image is an aged, cracked stone sundial, worn by time, with wild grass swaying gently around it. To the west, a vine-draped hall entrance leads back into the mansion's gallery. To the north, a weather-worn stone staircase spirals upward toward a looming, shadowy tower. Additionally, moss-covered stones on the floor hint at the outline of a sealed stairway descending into mysterious darkness below. The overall atmosphere should convey a sense of mystery and timelessness, with gentle shadows and cool, silvery illumination.",
  "transform": "Now transform the image to reflect the following changes: The moss-covered stones have slid aside, revealing a dark, descending staircase into subterranean depths. The path to the northern tower staircase now appears clearer and more inviting, subtly illuminated by additional soft moonlight breaking through the clouds above. Maintain the dramatic lighting and mysterious ambiance, enhancing the sense of discovery and progression in the scene."
