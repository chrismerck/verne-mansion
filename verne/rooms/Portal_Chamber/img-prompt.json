  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. Depict the 'Portal Chamber', a mysterious, ancient chamber marked by Victorian-inspired architecture. At the room's center stands a colossal stone archway, intricately carved with arcane sigils that encircle its structure. The hollow middle of the archway shimmers faintly with subtle, otherworldly light, suggesting dormant magical potential. To one side of the chamber, a narrow corridor, dimly illuminated by flickering gas lamps, leads southward back toward an alchemical laboratory. The chamber's walls are composed of aged stone, etched with enigmatic symbols, and the floor is paved in worn flagstones. The ambiance is mysterious and foreboding, with shadows cast by the dramatic lighting, enhancing the sense of ancient, hidden power within the chamber.",
  "transform": "Now, transform the image to depict the archway activated and dramatically changed. The previously faint shimmer at the archway's center now surges vibrantly, swirling with a turbulent vortex of limitless, star-filled night. Arcane sigils carved into the stone glow intensely with a mystical radiance, illuminating the entire chamber in a powerful, otherworldly hue. The room's shadows are deepened and intensified by the bright, swirling portal energy, heightening the sense of awe and cosmic mystery. Convey the magnitude of this supernatural event with dramatic lighting and vivid detail."
