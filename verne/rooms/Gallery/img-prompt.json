  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. The room is a spacious gallery with tall marble pillars supporting a grand vaulted ceiling adorned with intricate Victorian-era molding and decorative details. In the center of the room stands a marble sculpture atop an ornate pedestal, its form obscured beneath an elegant silk veil. To the west, an arched glass doorway reveals glimpses of an ivy-filled conservatory bathed in moonlight. To the east, an open hallway framed by ornate archways leads out to a darkened courtyard. Southward, a wide stone archway connects the gallery back to the grand foyer. The ambiance is mysterious and refined, with soft shadows cast dramatically by warm gaslight sconces along the walls and scattered moonbeams filtering in from the conservatory entrance.",
  "transform": "Now transform the image to reflect the room after changes have occurred: The marble sculpture's veil has been lifted, revealing its intricate carved details, and a thin shard of marble has chipped free from the sculpture. Adjust the lighting to subtly highlight the exposed features of the sculpture, emphasizing the spot where the shard has broken away. Maintain the dramatic ambiance, but slightly increase the brightness around the sculpture to draw attention to this central event. The rest of the gallery should remain consistent with its original appearance."
