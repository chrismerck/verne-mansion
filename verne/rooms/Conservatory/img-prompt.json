  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. Depict the Conservatory, a once-grand space now fallen into elegant decay. Moonlight streams dramatically through broken glass panes, casting intricate shadows onto an overgrown stone fountain at the room's center, now partially choked by ivy and moss. The architecture retains its Victorian elegance, with ornate wrought-iron detailing and lush vegetation overtaking the interior. On the northern wall, a sturdy wrought-iron door stands slightly ajar, revealing glimpses of an armory beyond. On the eastern side, a graceful archway draped heavily with ivy leads back toward a gallery, hinting at further exploration. The atmosphere is mysterious, quiet, and faintly magical, evoking a sense of forgotten grandeur and hidden secrets.",
  "transform": "Now transform the image to reflect the following changes: The conservatory's central fountain is animated, water now gently flowing upward, defying gravity and forming a glowing, sapphire-blue droplet suspended in midair above it. The droplet radiates soft blue illumination, slightly brightening the room and enhancing the mystical ambiance. The wrought-iron door to the north stands fully open, inviting exploration toward the armory, while the ivy-covered archway to the east remains unchanged. Maintain the dramatic, moonlit atmosphere but intensify the magical quality of the scene."
