  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. Depict a cellar with aged cobwebs draping from splintered wooden beams overhead. A cracked, dusty barrel lies overturned on the stone floor. Nearby, a rickety wooden ladder leads upwards toward a closed trapdoor in the ceiling. On the west wall, a rusted iron door is set into aged brickwork, slightly ajar, hinting at a dark passage beyond. The ambiance is somber and mysterious, filled with shadows cast by warm, flickering lantern light that illuminates the textures of old wood, stone, and iron.",
  "transform": "Now transform the image to reflect the following changes: The cracked barrel has been rolled aside, revealing a sturdy wooden oar lying on the stone floor beneath it. Adjust the lighting to spotlight this discovery, drawing attention to the newly uncovered oar. Maintain the dramatic and mysterious ambiance, emphasizing the subtle glow of lantern light highlighting the oar and surrounding area."
