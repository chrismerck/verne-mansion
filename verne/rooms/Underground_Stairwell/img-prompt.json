  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. Depict an underground stairwell constructed from weathered stone walls, damp with moisture and glistening slightly in the dim, flickering illumination. Dripping water should be visibly running down the stone surfaces, forming small puddles on the uneven stone floor. A sputtering torch rests in a rusted iron bracket mounted on one of the stone walls, casting wavering warm orange glows and shadows across the room. To the south, show a dark, damp passageway leading toward faintly visible water, reflecting distant glimmers. On the eastern wall, include a heavy, sealed iron hatch with intricate Victorian-era ironwork, firmly locked and mysterious in appearance. In the center, depict a spiraling staircase ascending upward, its steps worn from age, disappearing into the shadows above.",
  "transform": "Now transform the scene: the heavy iron hatch on the eastern wall is ajar, revealing a dark passageway beyond with a chill draft visibly flowing outward as faint wisps of mist. Adjust the lighting slightly to emphasize the newly opened hatch, adding subtle blueish tones to highlight the mysterious atmosphere, while maintaining the warm glow from the torch. Ensure all other elements\u2014the dripping water, stone textures, spiral staircase, and southern passageway\u2014remain clearly visible and consistent with the original depiction."
