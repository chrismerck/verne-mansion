  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. The room is an Observatory featuring a high domed ceiling painted deep midnight blue, intricately depicting glittering constellations that shimmer faintly, illuminated by subtle ambient starlight. At the center of the room stands a large, ornate brass telescope, mounted on an elaborate mechanical pedestal with intricate gears and levers, clearly inspired by Victorian steampunk aesthetics. To the east, a narrow wrought-iron gate opens onto the armory, slightly ajar to hint at passage beyond. To the south, a winding stone staircase spirals downward toward the courtyard, bordered by wrought-iron railings with Victorian-style scrollwork. The ambiance is calm and mysterious, evoking a sense of exploration and wonder, with cool moonlight filtering in from above, softly illuminating the polished brass and stone surfaces.",
  "transform": "Now adjust the image to reflect the activated state of the room: The brass telescope is now actively in use, its polished lens glowing softly with a mystical blue hue. Through the telescope, faint illuminated lines trace out the shape of a constellation, appearing to float gently in mid-air. The parchment nearby on a small wooden table glows faintly, showing a detailed star chart forming clearly visible lines and symbols. The atmosphere becomes slightly brighter, charged with subtle magical energy, enhancing the sense of discovery and wonder within the observatory."
