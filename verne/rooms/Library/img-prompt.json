  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. Depict a grand library filled with towering shelves covered in a thick layer of dust. A large, antique rotating globeshelf stands at the center, its brass fittings tarnished and ornate, creaking softly as if recently moved. Near the shelves stands a silent, imposing statue carved from pale stone depicting a robed librarian holding an open book, eyes solemnly watching over the room. On the floor, set into the polished wood, lies a sealed trapdoor with an intricate iron stair mechanism that appears firmly locked. To the west, a solid wooden door, elaborately carved and slightly worn, leads back toward the foyer. The room appears mysterious and scholarly, with shafts of pale moonlight filtering through tall, narrow windows, illuminating floating motes of dust and casting long, intricate shadows across the scene.",
  "transform": "Now transform the image to reflect changes: The trapdoor is now open, revealing a spiral iron staircase that descends into a shadowy darkness below. The mechanism, previously sealed, is clearly disengaged, with gears and levers visibly shifted. Enhance the dramatic lighting by adding a warm glow emanating from the newly revealed opening, casting flickering, mysterious shadows around the room. Maintain the dusty, scholarly atmosphere, but subtly increase the sense of adventure and intrigue through this new element."
