  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. Depict a subterranean lake shimmering faintly in gentle, eerie hues, illuminating the rough stone walls of the cavernous space. A small wooden boat, Victorian in design with elegant, ornate carvings along its edges, rocks gently at its moorings, tethered to a weathered dock extending from the foreground. Noticeably, the boat lacks an oar. To one side, a dark stone passageway, framed by moss-covered masonry, leads northward into shadowy depths. The water is calm, reflecting the subtle glow and creating a mysterious, quiet atmosphere, as if frozen in time.",
  "transform": "Now transform the image to clearly depict the same subterranean dock, but place a sturdy wooden oar resting securely within the boat's oarlocks. Additionally, embed a sapphire-bright gem in the boat\u0002\u0019s prow, casting a soft blue glow onto the lake's surface and surroundings, subtly highlighting the passageway and dock in cool, mystical tones. Enhance the lighting slightly to reflect the boat's readiness for crossing, maintaining the dramatic and mysterious ambiance."
