  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. The room is an armory filled with meticulously arranged suits of armor standing in silent rows, their polished metal surfaces reflecting dim, warm gaslight fixtures mounted on ornate walls. A wall-mounted weapon rack bristles with an assortment of ancient weapons, including spears, swords, and axes, all meticulously maintained yet clearly aged. Across the northern wall, a heavy, barred metal gate blocks passage to another chamber, hinting at further mysteries. A sturdy wooden door set in an ornate frame lies in the southern wall, offering an exit back toward the conservatory. The room should evoke a sense of quiet strength and antiquity, with shadows cast dramatically by the armor and weapons, and the play of gaslight illuminating intricate Victorian details such as brass fittings and richly patterned wallpaper.",
  "transform": "Now transform the image to show the armory after the northern gate has been opened. The heavy barred metal gate should now stand ajar, revealing a stone staircase ascending into a starlit chamber above. Soft silver-blue moonlight pours gently down these stairs, mixing with the warm glow of the gaslights in the armory, creating an inviting yet mysterious ambiance. Shadows shift slightly, highlighting the open gate and the revealed path upward, inviting exploration."
