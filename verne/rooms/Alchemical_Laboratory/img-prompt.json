  "prompt": "Please generate a landscape photorealistic image of a room in a Jules Verne-themed Victorian mansion. Make the lighting dramatic and bright enough for the scene to be clearly visible. The room is an Alchemical Laboratory, filled with intricate Victorian-era scientific equipment. Glowing, colorful liquids bubble softly in delicate, ornate glassware arranged meticulously on wooden benches and shelves. At the center prominently stands a gleaming brass alembic, reflecting the room's mysterious and arcane ambiance. On the northern wall, a dormant stone portal carved with intricate, arcane symbols stands silent, its center dark and inactive. To the south, a small wooden boat is moored, gently bobbing on a subterranean lake visible through a stone archway, connecting the laboratory to the dock beyond. The atmosphere is filled with intrigue and a sense of scientific mysticism, illuminated by the softly glowing liquids and flickering candlelight casting dramatic shadows across stone walls covered with ancient inscriptions and diagrams.",

Show the legendary Philosopher's Stone materializing\u2014radiant and glowing\u2014in the palm of a hand extended toward the alembic. Simultaneously, make the previously dormant stone portal to the north begin vibrating visibly, its engraved runes illuminating brightly as it activates, suggesting a surge of power and mystery now emanating from its swirling center. Enhance the dramatic lighting and mystical atmosphere to emphasize this climactic moment."
